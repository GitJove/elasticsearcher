elasticsearcher
===============

This agnostic package is a wrapper around the [elasticsearch PHP API](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/index.html).
It allows for easier query building and index management. It still gives access to the elasticsearch PHP client, for more
advanced usage.
